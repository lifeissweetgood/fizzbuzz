Fizzbuzz Implementations

Implementing fizzbuzz in as many different languages as I feel like.

# What is the Fizzbuzz test?
For more info, see http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest

# The algorithm
(From the above link): "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'."

NOTE: I modified it slightly so that it takes user input to determine the number to print up to instead of hardcoding it to up to 100.

# C implementation
$ gcc -o fizzbuzz fizzbuzz.c    // To compile it

$ ./fizzbuzz [num]              // To run it

# Java implementation
$ javac fizzbuzz.java           // To compile it

$ java fizzbuzz                 // To run it

# Python implementation
$ python fizzbuzz.py [num]
